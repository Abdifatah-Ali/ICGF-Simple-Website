# ICGF-Website
This is a simple website that I created for my local Islamic community. This project was to just practice my HMTL&CSS skills. Unfortunately, this simple page is not responsive yet, I will work on it and update the files soon to make it mobile friendly. I may also completely change the layout. Any suggestions to make the project better are appreicated. 
You can check the project by the clicking this link below:
